# IoT-Motion-Detector-With-NodeMCU-and-BLYNK(Alarm System)
In this group Project ,which is  developed for the Internet of Things (IoT), we will investigate a very simple tutorial to show how ease is to implement an IoT project with NodeMCU and Blynk.  Any time that we a movement is detected by the sensor, a message provide by Blynk is send to a smartphone.
