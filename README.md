# IoT-Motion-Detector-With-NodeMCU-and-BLYNK(Alarm System)

## About: 

### In this group Project ,which is  developed for the Internet of Things (IoT), we will investigate a very simple tutorial to show how ease is to implement an IoT project with NodeMCU and Blynk.  Any time that we a movement is detected by the sensor, a message provide by Blynk is send to a smartphone. The purpose of this project is to be permanently  expandable while utilizing cheap and reliable material for our project.

## Hardware:

### 
• NodeMcu Lua ESP-12E ESP8266 WIFI

• Arduino HC-SR501 Human Body Pyroelectric Infrared Pir

• Resistor (1K, 2.2K and 330ohm)

• LED

• Breadboard

• Cables
